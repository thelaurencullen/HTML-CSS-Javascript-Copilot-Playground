            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Cook the Gluten-Free Pasta:
                <ul>
                  <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gluten-free pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
                  
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Sauté the Tomatoes and Spinach:
                <ul>
                  <li>In a large skillet, heat the garlic-infused olive oil over medium heat.</li>
                  <li>Add the diced tomatoes (canned or fresh) and let them simmer for about 5 minutes until they start to break down and release their juices.</li>
                  <li>Stir in the chopped spinach and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the spinach wilts.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Add Olives, Spices, and Parsley:
                <ul>
                  <li>Stir in the sliced olives and add your choice of low FODMAP spices (e.g., dried basil, dried oregano, or dried thyme) to taste. Start with 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of each, depending on your preference.</li>
                  <li>Continue to cook for another 2 minutes, allowing the olives and spices to blend with the sauce.</li>
                  <li>Season the sauce with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using). Adjust the seasoning to your taste.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Combine with Gluten-Free Pasta:
                <ul>
                  <li>Add the cooked and drained gluten-free pasta to the skillet with the tomato and spinach mixture. Toss everything together to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce. Cook for an additional 2 minutes to heat the pasta through.</li>
                  
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Serve:
                <ul>
                  <li>Divide the pasta into serving plates or bowls.</li>
                  <li>Garnish with extra chopped parsley and vegan Parmesan cheese or nutritional yeast if desired.</li>
                 
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
